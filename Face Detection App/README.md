# Face Detection App

Everyone has listened about the face detection program built using python but here we have created an android app using machine learning kit on firebase which will do the same stuff as the python program.

It is a simple app with a simple UI in which the user will be able to detect the face and the user can also use both front camera and back camera using this app.
